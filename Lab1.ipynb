    "================\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning outcomes of this session are\n",
    "\n",
    "-   to have an introductory understanding of Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To have an introductory understanding of the library NumPy,\n",
    "    particularly with respect to vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   To examine a case where vectors can be analysed that have a much\n",
    "    larger dimension than 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks\n",
    "=========\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven’t encountered this before this is an example of a notebook\n",
    "(specifically a Jupyter notebook). This brings together text and code\n",
    "into one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parts of this screen which have \"In \\[ \\]:\" to the left are referred\n",
    "to as cells. Cells are pieces of code that can be run. You can run the\n",
    "cells by clicking on the cell and pressing Control + Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the cell generates output it will appear immediately after the cell\n",
    "in question when you do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not just click through all the cells without thinking about what each\n",
    "cell is going to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There will be cells that are empty - you will need to fill them!**\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that the cells are in order and you should enter\n",
    "them in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, you will be largely running things interactively but\n",
    "it’s best to set up an editor window, type in there and then run the\n",
    "script (The F5 key will very much be your friend here).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on Help and Keyboard Shortcuts you will get a list of\n",
    "shortcuts for doing particular operations (I find the one for creating a\n",
    "cell below the one you are using is very useful).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to save your notebook you can click on the diskette icon but\n",
    "remember that if you restart your binder session the information will be\n",
    "lost. To keep a permanent version on your machine, click on File and\n",
    "then Download as and then Notebook. When you restart your binder session\n",
    "on the directory page select Upload and then upload your file. You can\n",
    "then run it from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use <a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/\" class=\"uri\">Google Colab</a> for this exercise. You will need to use the tab on \n",
    "the left hand side to load the data files which you can download from the github repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run Jupyter directly from the department server, (download the repository and type jupyter notebook from the command line). \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can also run Jupyter from your own computer. Instructions on\n",
    "this can be found at\n",

something and then plunging\\ninto the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some\\nconsolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could\\nlook at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for\\nyou to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted\\nto kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt\\nmind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you\\nto suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too\\nin 1/2 a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or\\nthe dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs\\nof men i suppose never dream of washing it from i years end to the other\\nthe most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure\\nitll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age\\nill throw them the 1st thing in the morning till i see if the

he thinks all women are the same\\nand i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he\\nhalf faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly\\ntoo with our 2 photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but\\nthen what am i going to do about him though\\n\\nno thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no\\nnothing in his

god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an\\nold lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and\\ntempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite

like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd\\nbe much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you\\nwouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do\\nyou ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every\\npenny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she\\ndoes she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the

why i suppose hes running wild now\\nout at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on\\naccount of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those\\nthat have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not\\nable to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching\\nthe two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that\\ndisheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that\\nlittle woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor\\nchild but i knew well id never have another our 1st death too it was we\\nwere never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms\\nabout that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the\\ntime it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the\\ncity meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother\\nwouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still\\nits a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the\\nair of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he\\nwants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you\\ni hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a\\ndreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us\\nso snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa\\nin the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young\\nhardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah\\nwhat harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz\\ndelagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of\\nsanta maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las\\nsiete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a\\nname id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o\\nmy and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers\\nramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me\\nif i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a\\nday older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the\\nspanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten\\nit all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any\\nperson place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous\\nmrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the\\ntwo ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish\\nand he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity\\nhe didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good\\nsleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit\\nof toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the\\nwoman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and\\ntasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could\\nbear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all\\nright since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me\\nall the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very\\nfunny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half\\nawake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord\\nthe cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing\\nhe stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed\\nin the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in\\nthere for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed\\nin the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for i he can make it\\nfor 2 im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if\\nhe takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with\\nan intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red\\nslippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice\\nsemitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing\\njacket like the one long ago in walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 ill just give\\nhim one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old\\nbed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables\\nand cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits\\nall coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st man id meet\\ntheyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are\\nand the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to\\nmelt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill\\nthrow him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make\\nhis mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do\\nill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa\\npieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu\\nforte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out\\nof that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he\\nwanted that his wife is i s l o fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to\\nmy neck nearly not by him 5 or 6 times handrunning theres the mark of his\\nspunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought\\nto satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him\\nstand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and\\nmake him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault\\nif i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if\\nthats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not\\nmuch doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is\\nsupposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so\\nattractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my\\ndrawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick\\nhis tongue 7 miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell\\nhim i want li or perhaps 30/- ill tell him i want to buy underclothes\\nthen if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it\\nall out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine\\ncheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few\\ntimes he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it\\noff on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose\\nthat cant be helped ill do the indifferent l or 2 questions ill know by\\nthe answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every\\nturn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words\\nsmellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then\\nill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay\\nand friendly over it o but i was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing\\npfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of

are\\nflowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life\\nand the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i\\nsaw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get\\nround him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he\\nasked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the\\nsea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey\\nand mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the\\nsailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they\\ncalled it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with\\nthe thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish\\ngirls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in\\nthe morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who\\nelse from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all\\nclucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep\\nand the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and\\nthe big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of\\nyears old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like\\nkings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with\\nthe old windows of the posadas 2 glancing eyes a lattice hid for her\\nlover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the\\ncastanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman\\ngoing about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and\\nthe sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and\\nthe figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets\\nand the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the\\njessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was\\na flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the\\nandalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me\\nunder the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then\\ni asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i\\nyes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes\\nand drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and\\nhis heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes.\\n\\n\\n\\ntrieste-zurich-paris\\n1914-1921\\n\\n    \\n'"
